## What We Do

Provide chemical analysis and physical comparisons of many different types of materials and trace evidence.

Examinations are performed in order to identify a material in question or to determine if it could have originated from a particular source. The examinations and findings may also be useful as an investigative aid in cases where no suspect has yet been identified, or by associating a person with a particular location or occurrence, and may assist in establishing a sequence of events. In addition, identifying a material used at the time of an incident may be used to support or refute a witness statement.
