# Physical Sciences: Documents

## What We Do

Examine documents to determine whether they are authentic or if they have been altered, and to determine how they relate to a person, thing, event or time.

## Services

Authentication of documents by:

* comparing handwriting and signatures to identify or eliminate a particular writer
* comparing the pens, pencils, inks, paper and printing processes used to produce them
* examining them to detect and decipher erasures, indentations and alterations
