# Science for Justice

Ontario's Centre of Forensic Sciences (CFS) is one of the most extensive forensic science facilities in North America. It conducts scientific investigations in cases involving injury or death for crimes against persons or property.

We are dedicated to the safety of Ontarioâ€™s communities and to supporting justice by providing timely and high quality forensic science services.

We will drive innovation across the organization and deliver forensic science services that anticipate the needs of public safety.
